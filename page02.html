            <h3 style="color: #72CB3B;">Original Creation of the Game</h3>

            <p>Tetris was invented in 1984 by <span style="color: #FF971C;">Alexey Pajitnov</span>, a young researcher at Moscow's Academy of Science. Inspired by a puzzle board game called "Pentomino", Alexey set out to create a digital version with a twist: the puzzle pieces, instead of being passive, fell down the playing field in real-time.</p>

            <p>With the help of his colleagues, <span style="color: #FF971C;">Dmitry Pavlovsky</span> and <span style="color: #FF971C;">Vadim Gerasimov</span>, the game rapidly grew in popularity. It crossed the boundaries of the Soviet Union and soon became one of the most recognized and played video games worldwide.</p>

                "The program wasn't complicated. There was no scoring, no levels. But I started playing and I couldn't stop." - <span style="color: #FF971C;">Alexey Pajitnov</span>

            <h3 style="color: #72CB3B; margin-top: 20px;">The Game Meets Politics and Espionage</h3>


            <p>The rights to Tetris were originally held by the Soviet state, and the USSR didn't have the same kind of copyright or intellectual property laws as the West. This caused significant confusion when Western companies wanted to license the game. In 1986, the game made its way to Hungary, where it was popularized on platforms like the Apple II and Commodore 64, drawing the attention of Western game developers and publishers.</p>

            <p>Several companies, including <span style="color: #FF971C;">Atari</span> and <span style="color: #FF971C;">Nintendo</span>, vied for the official rights to distribute Tetris on various platforms. Business negotiations had shades of Cold War intrigue, with secretive meetings in Moscow hotels, and intermediaries trying to get the rights from the USSR's software export company, Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg). Ultimately, <span style="color: #FF971C;">Nintendo</span> secured the rights for console distribution, leading to the game's enormous success on the Game Boy.</p>

            <p>After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, <span style="color: #FF971C;">Alexey Pajitnov</span> regained the rights to his creation in 1996. Since then, Tetris has remained a global phenomenon, continually adapted and enjoyed by generations of players.</p>
